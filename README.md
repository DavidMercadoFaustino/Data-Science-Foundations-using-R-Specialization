# Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization
## Repository from the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins Coursera
This Specialization covers foundational data science tools and techniques, including getting, cleaning, and exploring data, programming in R, and conducting reproducible research. 
The five courses in this specialization are the very same courses that make up the first half of the Data Science Specialization. This specialization is presented for learners who want to start and complete the foundational part of the curriculum first.
